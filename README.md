> source code for the `Python`  version of the "Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide" course - Complex solution (multi Docker containers)

## Execute it locally using

$ docker-compose up --build

Navigate to http://localhost:3050/

## Continuous Integration with Travis CI + Amazon AWS

- The repository must be created on https://github.com/

- The repository must be assigned from GitHub on https://travis-ci.com/. The following environment variables must be set up:
1) AWS_ACCESS_KEY
2) AWS_SECRET_KEY
3) DOCKER_ID
4) DOCKER_PASSWORD

- The following instances must be created on Amazon EWS
1) Elastic Beanstalk (EB)
2) Relational Database Service (RDS) for Postgres
3) ElastiCache for Redis
4) Custom Security Group
5) Identity and Access Magagement (IAM)

## Within the code you can see how to
- Create different Docket Container Types and relate all of them
  1) React Client App
  2) Python API with Flusk Framework
  3) Python Console
  4) Postgres
  5) Redis
  6) NGINX
- Use Postgres from a Docker Container with Python
- Use Redis from a Docker Container with Python creating a subscription on the Web API App and subscribe to it on the Console App.
- Send dynamic JSON responses from the Python Flusk Framework Web API
- Use Docker Compose to run and relate easily different Docker Components
- Use NIGIX Container to run the React Client App
- Use NIGIX Container as Reverse Proxy with Python Flusk Framework Web API
- Work with different AWS Amazon service types to deploy a multi container Docker application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Upload own Containers to Docker Hub and download them with the deployment
- Use Travis CI for the Continuous Integration Workflow
